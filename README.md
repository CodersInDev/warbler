## Why?
We want to learn how to handle endpoints, with an aim to make a version of Twitter.

## What?
We will have the ability to create Warbles, see existing Warbles, and delete something you have previously warbled.

## How?
- [ ] Make Create, Read, and Delete endpoints
- [ ] Store Warbles as JSON in memory
- [ ] Store Warbles in the file system
- [ ] Use Cookies to restrict Warble deletion to the browser from which the Warble was originally created.
- [ ] Move Warbles to Redis
- [ ] Deploy to Heroku
- [ ] Add real-time updates of Warbles
